    "# Part 2.2 Using Sobel in Vitis Vision Library to Extract Image Edges\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Brief Introduction on Vitis Vision Library\n",
    "\n",
    "* The AMD Vitis™ vision library has been designed to work in the Vitis development environment and provides a software interface for computer vision functions accelerated on an FPGA device. Vitis vision library functions are mostly similar in functionality to their OpenCV equivalent. Any deviations, if present, are documented.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Basic Features for All Vitis Vision Library Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "All Vitis vision library functions follow a common format. The following properties are true for all functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* All the functions are designed as templates and all arguments that are images, must be provided as `xf::cv::Mat`.\n",
    "* All functions are defined in the `xf::cv` namespace.\n",
    "* Some of the major template arguments are:\n",
    "  * Maximum size of the image to be processed\n",
    "  * Datatype defining the properties of each pixel\n",
    "  * Number of pixels to be processed per clock cycle\n",
    "  * Depth of the hls::stream defined in `xf::cv::Mat`\n",
    "  * Other compile-time arguments relevent to the functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Vitis vision library contains enumerated datatypes which enables you to configure `xf::cv::Mat`. For more details on `xf::cv::Mat`, see the [xf::cv::Mat Image Container Class](https://docs.amd.com/r/MB7YwCDoUdYtdARUnAYaJA/YlQqjjXiyAeT02v87sduFA).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Vitis Vision Warppers around HLS Kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "All Vitis Vision kernels are provided with C++ function templates (located at `<Github repo>`/include) with image containers as objects of xf::cv::Mat class. In addition, these kernels will work either in stream based (where complete image is read continuously) or memory mapped (where image data access is in blocks).\n",
    "\n",
    "Vitis flow (OpenCL) requires kernel interfaces to be memory pointers with width in power(s) of 2. So glue logic is required for converting memory pointers to xf::cv::Mat class data type and vice-versa when interacting with Vitis Vision kernel(s). Wrapper(s) are build over the kernel(s) with this glue logic. The following examples provide a methodology to handle different kernel (Vitis Vision kernels located at `<Github repo>`/include) types (stream and memory mapped), you can find it in [Wrappers around HLS Kernel(s) • Vitis Libraries](https://docs.amd.com/r/en-US/Vitis_Libraries/vision/overview.html_1_1_1)\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, we will introduce **xf::CV::Mat** , **xf::cv::Array2xfMat** and **xf::cv::xfMat2Array** since they are used in the sobel code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2.1 Image Pixel Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "[Data types](https://docs.amd.com/r/en-US/Vitis_Libraries/vision/api-reference.html_0_3) will differ depending on the combination of the depth of pixels and the number of channels in the image. The generic nomenclature of the parameter is listed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "XF_<Number of bits per pixel><signed (S) or unsigned (U) or float (F)>C<number of channels>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, for an 8-bit pixel - unsigned -1 channel the data type is `XF_8UC1.`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2.2 Image Container Class - xf::CV::Mat\n",
    "\n",
    "- `xf::cv::Mat` is a template class that serves as a container for storing image data and its attributes.\n",
    "- The `xf::cv::Mat` image container class is similar to the `cv::Mat` class of the OpenCV library.\n",
    "- For example, in the sobel Vitis Vision Library code, `xf::cv::Mat<IN_TYPE, HEIGHT, WIDTH, NPPCX, XF_CV_DEPTH_IN>in_mat(rows, cols);`\n",
    "  - For template parameter descriptions\n",
    "    - | Parameter | Description                                                                                                                      |\n",

This function would read from the array pointer and write into `xf::cv::Mat` based on the particular configuration (bit-depth, channels, pixel-parallelism) the xf::cv::Mat was created. `Array2xfMat` supports line stride.

    "- For data depth of `m_axi`, it is the number of pixels of the input image or output image, like `static constexprint__XF_DEPTH= (HEIGHT*WIDTH* (XF_PIXELWIDTH(IN_TYPE, NPPCX)) /8) / (INPUT_PTR_WIDTH/8);`, in which\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `XF_PIXELWIDTH(IN_TYPE, NPPCX)` is replaced during compilation with a template class `DataType<flags, npc>::pixelwidth`.\n",
    "    * `IN_TYPE` specifies the image pixel type. In the Sobel filter, the input image type must be 8-bit, unsigned, supporting 1 and 3 channels (XF_8UC1 and XF_8UC3).\n",
    "    * `NPPCX` refers to the number of pixels to be processed per cycle, with possible options being `XF_NPPC1` for 1 pixel and `XF_NPPC8` for 8 pixels.\n",
    "    * `pixelwidth` represents the total bit-width of all color channels for a single pixel. When `IN_TYPE=XF_8UC1` (8-bit grayscale) and `NPPCX=XF_NPPC1`, `datawidth` is 8. When `IN_TYPE=XF_8UC3` (8-bit RGB color) and `NPPCX=XF_NPPC1`, `datawidth` is 24.\n",
    "    * Therefore, dividing `datawidth` by the bit depth per channel (8 bits) yields the corresponding number of channels.\n",
    "  * `INPUT_PTR_WIDTH` is the bit-width per pixel for the image. For 8-bit grayscale or RGB images, this value is 8, hence `INPUT_PTR_WIDTH/8` signifies a single pixel.\n",
    "  * Consequently, `depth` corresponds to the total number of pixels to be processed in the input stage, similarly for the output.\n",
