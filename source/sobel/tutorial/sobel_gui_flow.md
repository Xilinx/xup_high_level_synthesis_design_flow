# GUI Flow Tutorial: Implementing Sobel to PYNQ Framework

## Objective

Upon completion of this lab, you should have learned:

- How to build a project using Vitis HLS
- Simulation, synthesis and IP export in Vitis HLS
- Integrating HLS exported IP using Vivado
- Build a simple application using PYNQ

In short, you will learn the basic flow of accelerated core design and deployment to PYNQ using HLS. Due to space limitation, this experiment only introduces the basic tool operation process.

## Environmental equirements

- KV260 remote lab service or physical board
- Vitis HLS 2023.2
- Vivado 2023.2

## Experimental steps

### 1. Design Sobel IP in Vitis_HLS

#### 1.1 Create a new project

1. Open the **Vitis HLS** software and click on **Create Project** to create a new project
2. Enter the project name sobe_opt in **Project name**, click **Browse** to select an appropriate directory location, and click **Next**.

   <img src="./img/1.1.1.png" title="" alt="1.1.1.png" width="430">
3. Click **Add Files... **, add **sobel.hpp** and **sobel_opt.cpp** from **kernel** directory to the project
   `<img src="./img/1.1.2.png" title="" alt="1.1.2.png" width="430">`
4. Click on the **Browse** button in the **Top Function** column, select **sobel**, which is the top-level function when we do the synthesis, and click on **Next**

   <img src="./img/1.1.2.png" title="" alt="1.1.2.png" width="430">
5. Click **Add Files... **, add sobel_tb**.cpp** in **src** directory to the project, click **Next**

   <img src="./img/1.1.3.png" title="" alt="1.1.3.png" width="430">
6. Next, go to the **Solution Configuration** interface.

   1. Keep the other options unchanged, click **...** on the far right of the **Part Selection**.
   2. Click **Boards** and search **KV260** (Kira KV260 Vision Starter Kit SOM).
   3. Select and click **OK**.

   <img src="./img/1.1.4.png" title="" alt="1.1.4.png" width="430">
7. Click **Finish** to complete the creation of the project

#### 1.2 C-Simulation

1. After completing the project creation, **Vitis HLS** jumps to a new interface, which consists of four main parts:

   1. The **Explorer** at the top left, which contains the various files in the project
   2. The **Flow Navigator** at the bottom left, which shows the various parts of the HLS design
   3. The **editor area** at the top right, where developers modify the code of the design
   4. The **Console** at the bottom right contains the console, error messages, version control, etc.

      <img src="./img/1.2.1.png" title="" alt="1.2.1.png" width="630">
2. Next, we perform C simulation on the design.

   1. Click **Run C Simulation** in the **Flow Navigator** at the bottom left.
   2. In the **C Simulation Dialog** window that pops up, make no changes.
   3. Click **OK** for C simulation

      <img title="" src="./img/1.2.2.png" alt="1.2.2.png" width="514">
3. Wait a few seconds, after the simulation is complete **Vitis HLS** automatically opens a log file and you can see that the design has passed the C simulation

   <img src="./img/1.2.3.png" title="" alt="1.2.3.png" width="5">

#### 1.3 C-Synthesis

1. Next, we perform C synthesis on the design. Click on **Run C Synthesis** in the **Flow Navigator** at the bottom left, and in the **C Synthesis - Active Solution** window that pops up, leave the options unchanged and click on **OK** to start synthesis.

   ![1.3.1.png](./img/1.3.1.png)
2. Wait a few seconds and **Vitis HLS** will print the information of its combined steps in **Console**
3. After the synthesis is completed, the **Systhesis Summary(solution1)** window will pop up, where we can see the clock frequency information, the number of clock cycles and resource consumption given by **Vitis HLS** (in different versions of Vitis HLS, the synthesis results may vary and the resource usage estimates are more conservative, the final resource usage should be based on the implementation results)

   ![1.3.2.png](./img/1.3.2.png)

#### 1.4 C/RTL Co-simulation

1. In the following, we perform a C-RTL co-simulation of the design. Click **RUN C/RTL COSIMULATION** in the **Flow Navigator** at the bottom left, keep the options unchanged in the **Co-simulation Dialog** window that pops up, and click **OK** to start the synthesis

   ![1.4.1.png](./img/1.4.1.png)
2. Waiting for about 1 minute, the synthesis time of C/RTL co-simulation is usually longer, after the end of the simulation will pop up **Co-simulation Report(solution1)** window, containing information such as whether to pass the simulation, performance estimation, etc.

   ![1.4.2.png](./img/1.4.2.png)

#### 1.5 Export RTL

1. Next, we perform an RTL export of the design. Click **Export RTL** in the **Flow Navigator** at the bottom left, keep the options unchanged in the pop-up window of **Export RTL**, and click **OK** to start the RTL export

   ![1.5.1.png](./img/1.5.1.png)
2. Wait about half a minute, **Console** prints **Finished Export RTL/Implementation.** indicating that the RTL design has been exported, you can find the exported file in **\kernel\sobel_opt\solution1\impl\export.zip**
3. For subsequent use, please extract the **\fir_hls_prj\solution1\impl\export.zip** file to its directory to get a **\kernel\sobel_opt\solution1\impl\export** folder

   <img src="./img/1.5.2.png" title="" alt="1.5.2.png" width="430">
