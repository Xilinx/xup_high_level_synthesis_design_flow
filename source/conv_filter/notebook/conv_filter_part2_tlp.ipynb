    "The steps of optimize the convolution filter application from macro perspective consists the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step1: Partition the Code into a Load-Compute-Store Pattern\n",
    "- Step2: Partition the Compute Blocks into Smaller Function\n",
    "- Step3: Connect the Load, Compute, and Store Functions\n",

    "## Step1: Partition the Code into a Load-Compute-Store Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "The load and store functions are responsible for moving data from global memory to kernel and moving data out of the kernel to global memory. Data transfers between the kernel and global memories have a big influence on overall system performance. If not properly done, they will throttle the kernel. Therefore, it is important to optimize the load and store functions to efficiently move data in and out of the kernel and feed the compute function optimally.\n",
    "\n",
    "To successfully partition the code into a Load-Compute-Store Pattern in order to meet the given the performance constraints, we need to examine the convolution kernel in some detail:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The core compute is done in a 4-level nested loop, but you can break it to the compute per output pixel produced.\n",
    "2. In terms of the output-pixels produced, it is clear from the filter source code that a single output pixel is produced when the inner two loops finish execution once.\n",
    "3. These two loops are essentially doing the sum-of-product on a coefficient matrix and image sub-matrix. The matrix sizes are defined by the coefficient matrix, which is $3 \\times 3$. The inner two loops are performing a dot product of size $9\\  (3\\times3)$. In other words, the two inner loops perform 9 multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations for every output pixel produced.\n",
    "4. Loading the data from interface into the coefficient matrix and image sub-matrix should be separated from the nested loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key advantages of custom design hardware accelerators, for which FPGAs are well suited, is the choice and architecture of custom data movers. These customized data movers facilitate efficient access to global device memory and optimize bandwidth utilization by reusing data. Specialized data movers at the interface with main memory can be built at the input and output of the data processing engine or processing elements. The convolution filter is an excellent example of this. Looking from a pure software implementation point of view, it seems that to produce a single sample at the output side requires 18 memory accesses at the input side and 1 write access to the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Memory Accesses to Read filter Co-efficients = 3x3 = 9\n",
    "Memory Accesses to Read Neighbouring Pixels  = 3x3 = 9\n",
    "Memory Accesses to Write to Output           = 1\n",
    "Total Memory Accesses                        = 19\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For a pure software implementation, even though many of these accesses can become fast because of caching, a large number of memory accesses will be a performance bottleneck. But designing on FPGA allows efficient data movement and access schemes to be easily built. One of the key and major advantages is the availability of substantial on-chip memory bandwidth (distributed and block memory) and the choice of a custom configuration of this bandwidth. This custom configuration choice essentially allows you to create an on-demand cache architecture tailored explicitly for the given algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, `hls::stream` variable is chosen to pass the data between these functions. Although the address of the input image is not contiguous when the window filter slides over the input image, the line buffer and window buffer caching methods can be used to cache some data at the expense of acceptable amount of on-chip storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two functions at the input and output read and write data from the device's global memory. The **ReadFromMem** function reads data and streams it for filtering. The **WriteToMem** function at the end of the chain writes processed pixel data to the device memory. The input data(pixels) read from the main memory is passed to the **Filter2D** function which can consume the pixel sample in a single cycle to perform MACs.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img title=\"\" src=\"./image/stream_of_blocks.png\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The **ReadFromMem** function and the **WriteToMem** function have something in common: they both convert data between the AXI memory map interface and the HLS data stream interface, but the data transfer direction is different. Here are three key points to note:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The height and width of the image are generally specified by the host side. When they are set as the boundary variables of the loop, HLS tool cannot infer the loop latency when synthesizing. This requires the use of assert statements to determine the maximum boundaries of the image height and width. Alternatively, the HLS Loop Tripcount directive can also be used to specify the maximum loop boundary.\n",
    "2. While reading and writing pixels into the HLS streaming data, the total length of the data stream is generally specified as the boundary of the loop. The total length of data must be consistent with the actual amount of data transmitted to the computing module, otherwise it is possible to cause  the co-simulation failure.\n",
    "3. The loop boundary variable can be multiplied by 64 and then divided by 64 to let the compiler know that the total number of pixels read and written is an integer multiple of 64. In this way, the compiler can automatically widen the interface data bit width and enhance data parallelism.\n",

    "The figure below illustrates the operation and requirements for a line and Window buffer. Each time through the loop, the window is shifted and filled with one pixel coming from the input and two pixels coming from the line buffer. Additionally, the input pixel is shifted into the line buffer in preparation to repeat the process on the next line. Note that in order to process one pixel each clock cycle, most elements of the window buffer must be read from and written to every clock cycle. The overall scheme (data mover) is built to maximize the data reuse providing maximum parallel data to the processing element.\n",

    "In this way, II of the computing unit can be optimized separately, and the instance can be repeatedly invoked to save computing resources. But this design approach introduces a much larger latency than decomposing it into a sequence of smaller sub-functions. As discussed in the interface best practice section, We have already used the dataflow architecture for reading and writing data, so it would be more reasonable to split the calculation part into sub functions and link all the modules using the stream interfaces shown in the following figure, the window2D and the filter2D function are connected using the hls::stream objects.\n",

    "With the following block diagram in mind, the next step is to understand how to customize data movers within the compute blocks using `hls::stream` object. The most challenging part is how to feed the input pixels stream into the line buffer and the window buffer of the WIndow2D function. Then, after a series of cache and data shifting operations, the convolution calculation matrix data can be pass on to the filter2D module in the form of streaming data.\n",
