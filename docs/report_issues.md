# Report an Issue

This page covers the basics to report an issue either to your instructor or using the built-in GitHub Issues tracker

When reporting an issue provide the following information.

- A brief description of the issue and how to reproduce it
- Section in lab or page you found the issue
- How are you running the tutorial? Cloud or on-premises
- Screenshots or code snippets if appropriate

  - Check how to [create and highlight code](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks)
- Tools and OS versions if the issue is in a lab

  - `vitis -version`
  - `xbutil --version`
  - `lsb_release -a`
  - platform information

Report the issue to your instructor or open a [new issue](https://github.com/Xilinx/xup_high_level_synthesis_design_flow/issues).
It is always a good idea to check previous issues in case that the issue has already been resolved.

Please use the templates to provide enough information so the likelihood of getting a useful answer is higher.
