1. Build the project.

## Create the SD Card Image and Test
### Create the bin files from lab1 and lab2.
1. Using the System Explorer, create directory called **SD\_image** under the **{labs}\lab8** directory.
1. In System Explorer, copy the **system\_wrapper.bit** of the lab1 project into the **SD\_image** directory and rename it **lab1.bit**, and do similar for lab2

    **{labs}/lab1/lab1.runs/impl\_1/system\_wrapper.bit -&gt; SD\_image/lab1.bit**

    **{labs}/lab2/lab2.runs/impl\_1/system\_wrapper.bit -&gt; SD\_image/lab2.bit**

    >The _bootgen_ command of Vitis Shell will be used to convert the bit files into the required binary format. The _bootgen_ requires a .bif file which has been provided in the sources/lab8 directory. The .bif file specifies the target .bit files.

1. Open a command prompt by selecting **Xilinx &gt; Vitis Shell.**
1. In the command prompt window, change the directory to the bitstreams directory using _cd_ command.
    ```bash
    cd {labs}/lab8/SD_image
    ```
1. Generate the partial bitstream files in the BIN format using the provided ".bif" files located in the _{sources}_ directory. Use the following command:
    ```bash
    bootgen -image {sources}/lab8/lab1_bit_files.bif -w -process\_bitstream bin
    ```
    ```bash
    bootgen -image {sources}/lab8/lab2_bit_files.bif -w -process\_bitstream bin
    ```
1. Rename the files **lab1.bit.bin** and **lab2.bit.bin** to **lab1.bin** and **lab2.bin**
1. The size of the file needs to match the size specified in the **lab8\_sd.c** file. The size can be determined by checking the file&#39;s properties. If the sizes do not match, then make the necessary change to the source code and save it (The values are defined as **LAB1\_BITFILE\_LEN** and **LAB2\_BITFILE\_LEN**).
