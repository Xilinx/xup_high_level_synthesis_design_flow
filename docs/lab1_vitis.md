# Vitis Design Flow Lab

## Introduction

This lab provides a basic introduction to high-level synthesis using the Vitis HLS tool flow. You will use Vitis HLS in GUI mode to create a project. You will simulate, synthesize, and implement the provided design.

## Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

* Create a new project using Vitis HLS in GUI mode
* Simulate a C design by using a self-checking test bench
* Synthesize the design
* Perform design analysis using the Analysis Perspective view
* Perform co-simulation on a generated RTL design by using a provided C test bench
* Implement a design
